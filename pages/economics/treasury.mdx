# Irysâ€™ Protocol Treasury

Irys employs a protocol-level treasury to ensure sustainable storage costs. Through upfront payments and balanced inflationary measures, the system protects against token dilution while incentivizing long-term data retention. This economic model aligns storage provider incentives with network stability.

## Upfront Payments

When users pay for storage in Irysâ€™ [data ledgers](/protocol/ledgers), they make a single upfront payment. This payment is based on the amount of data uploaded and the cost of storing a [partition](/protocol/partitions) for a year. Users posting data to Irysâ€™ permanent ledger pay for 200 years in advance, assuming a 1% annual decline in storage costs.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ’¡">
	Historically storage costs have decreased by approximately 30% annually. If storage costs decline faster
	than 1% annually, the duration the treasury can pay for future storage is extended, providing a safety
	margin against fluctuations in the protocol's native token price.

## Balanced Inflationary Measures

Irys has an inflationary token emission schedule with a fixed amount emitted each year through block rewards. The inflation rate gradually decreases with each block, ensuring a balanced approach to token supply and maintaining long-term economic stability.

## Block Rewards

To balance fairness and efficiency, Irys employs a reward adjustment mechanism. When rewards exceed predetermined thresholds, surplus inflationary rewards are redirected to the treasury. This dual-action approach enhances the treasuryâ€™s purchasing power while exerting deflationary pressure on the circulating token supply.

This safeguards both users and miners, fostering a stable, sustainable ecosystem that adapts to changing market conditions.

## Inflation-Resistant by Design

Irys combats token dilution through a self-sustaining treasury mechanism. As new tokens are minted, the treasury receives a proportional allocation, preserving its purchasing power relative to the overall supply. This approach ensures the treasury's ability to fund future data storage costs, maintaining long-term network stability and value for all stakeholders.
