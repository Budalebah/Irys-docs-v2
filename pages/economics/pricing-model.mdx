# Pricing Model

Irys has an up-front one-time fee model which simplifies the development and deployment of onchain applications. This **predictable and stable pricing** leads to better budgeting and planning for users.

The pricing model is based on a fixed model, defined by:

<div className="overflow-x-auto mx-1 rounded-2xl border border-gray-700 mt-5">
	<table className="min-w-full divide-y divide-gray-700 rounded-2xl">
		<thead className="bg-slate-800 text-white">
			<tr>
				<th className="px-4 py-2 text-left border border-gray-700">Parameter</th>
				<th className="px-4 py-2 text-left border border-gray-700">Description</th>
			</tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody className="divide-y divide-gray-700">
			<tr>
				<td className="px-4 py-2 border border-gray-700 align-top">Annualized Cost of Storing 1GB</td>
				<td className="px-4 py-2 border border-gray-700 align-top">
					The model uses the annualized cost of storing 1GB, as determined by the pricing parameter, as its
					starting point.
					<br />
					<p className="text-sm">* Updated annually</p>
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td className="px-4 py-2 border border-gray-700 align-top">Annualized Decay Rate</td>
				<td className="px-4 py-2 border border-gray-700 align-top">
					The model assumes a conservative 1% annual decay rate in storage costs, accounting for a wide
					range of potential improvements in technology and market efficiency over time.
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td className="px-4 py-2 border border-gray-700 align-top">Safe Minimum Number of Years</td>
				<td className="px-4 py-2 border border-gray-700 align-top">
					The pricing model calculates the one-time storage fee based on a safe minimum number of years
					(initially set to 700 years). This ensures that the fee charged is sufficient to cover storage
					costs for an extended period, providing peace of mind to users. The safety margins baked into the
					pricing model mean that in all but the very worst of outcomes the network can afford to pay for
					storage many multiples of 200 years into the future.
				</td>
