# How Irys Solves These Problems

Storage on Irys is designed to be both versatile and efficient, catering to a wide range of applications. Here’s how it works:

**Solving the Data Storage Challenge**: In the current landscape, data storage solutions often suffer from inefficiencies and vulnerabilities, leading to high costs, lack of scalability, and data integrity issues. Irys addresses these challenges by providing a robust, economically sustainable, and secure data storage platform.

**Multi-Ledger System**: Irys supports multiple data ledgers including the submit ledger for temporary storage and the publish ledger for permanent storage. This approach ensures that data can be stored cost-effectively in the short term and securely in the long term.

**Protocol-Managed Capacity**: Irys dynamically balances storage supply with demand, avoiding the pitfalls of over- or under-capacity that have plagued other datachains. This approach ensures miner profitability while maintaining a globally distributed network, optimizing both economic sustainability and network resilience.

**Verifiable Data**: Data on Irys is always verifiable, meaning that users can prove for themselves that their data is accurately stored and accessible when needed. This verifiability is a cornerstone of Irys’s commitment to data integrity.

**Economic Incentives**: Miners on the Irys network are incentivized to store data correctly and efficiently through an economic incentive system, ensuring the network remains robust and reliable. Additionally, miners make upfront economic commitments and are penalized for failing to store data, making it infeasible for bad actors to affect the network’s integrity.
