# Why Irys Exists

Irys exists as a solution to the most critical challenges in decentralized data storage and execution. In an industry where data storage and smart contract execution often operates in silo, Irys bridges this gap, creating a unified ecosystem that empowers developers and users alike.

1. Fast Verification: Enables efficient onchain data access through high-speed verifiability.
2. Stable Costs: Offers predictable storage pricing using fiat price approximation.
3. Flexible Storage: Provides multiple ledgers to accommodate various data storage needs.
4. Integrated Execution: Combines storage and smart contract execution via IrysVM, enabling Programmable Data.
5. Scalability: Enhances network capacity without compromising decentralization through protocol-managed growth.
6. Economic Sustainability: Implements a sustainable inflation model for long-term viability.

By addressing these issues, Irys creates an efficient platform for building advanced decentralized applications that seamlessly interact with onchain data. The protocol not only solves current limitations but also paves the way for future advancements and creations within the space. With Irys, developers can unleash their creativity, building applications that were previously impossible or impractical.
