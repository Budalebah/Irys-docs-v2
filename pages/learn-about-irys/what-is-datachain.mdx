# What is a Datachain?

A datachain is a blockchain optimized for data storage, making it significantly cheaper to store onchain data than blockchains focused on smart contracts and financial use cases. Irys' data storage is highly-optimized and verifiable, enabling the IrysVM to utilize onchain data during computations. This makes Irys the first truly programmable datachain.
