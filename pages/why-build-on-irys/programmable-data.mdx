# Programmable Data

## State Storage Costs

Smart contract chains optimized for execution face high costs primarily due to state storage. To address this, they've introduced various solutions like Blob Storage, Compressed NFTs, and ZK Compression, often leveraging separate blockchains or protocols optimized for storage. This results in complex hybrid architectures for dApps and services that depend on large-scale data storage.

## Irys's Integrated Solution

Irys integrates its storage and execution layers, allowing the [Irys Virtual Machine (IrysVM)](/why-build-on-irys/irysvm) to directly access stored data. This integration maintains the security and consensus rules standard in blockchain smart contract execution. The ability to securely access onchain data during smart contract execution, which Irys terms "Programmable Data," is a new feature for datachains. This approach enables developers to create more efficient, data-intensive decentralized applications within a unified system.

## Simplified Development

With Programmable Data, Irys integrates cost-effective data storage and smart-contract functionality, enabling dApps and services to interact programmatically with large amounts of onchain data within a single protocol and ecosystem. This streamlines development, lowers costs, and unlocks unprecedented composability, overcoming the limitations of fragmented integrations.

## Expanded Possibilities

By unleashing developer creativity, Programmable Data enables new use cases previously inaccessible due to high state storage costs. Developers can now build fully onchain applications, where the UI, state, and all data are stored onchain.

**Programmable Data enables two key capabilities:**

1. **Smart Contract Observation**: Smart contracts can monitor and respond to users' onchain activity across the entire network.
2. **Onchain Data Validation**: Smart contracts can read, verify and validate data posted to the blockchain.

These capabilities, combined with standard VM features such as tokenization, DeFi protocols, liquidity provision, and marketplace creation, enable the development of a new generation of fully decentralized applications and services. This integration of data and execution layers within a single blockchain ecosystem opens up possibilities for more complex, data-driven decentralized systems.
