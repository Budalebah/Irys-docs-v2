# Mining Guide

Irys' mining is a combination of:

- Useful Proof of Work (where every computed hash is actually proving storage of a random part of Irys’ overall storage).
- Staking a mining address.
- Pedging individual [partitions](/protocol/partitions).

## To Stake a Mining Address

1. Create a wallet.
2. Mint some tokens to it.
3. Post a staking transaction to the network.
4. Wait for the transaction to be confirmed.

## To Pledge a Partition

Once you have a staked mining address you can pledge one or more partitions by:

1. Posting a pledge transaction, and waiting until the end of the <a className="underline decoration-dashed" id="epoch">epoch.</a>
2. Waiting for the protocol to assign you a partition ID.
3. Packing the partition.

Regardless if you finish packing in time or not, the node will begin mining your partition in the next epoch.

## System Requirements

The minimum system requirements will be established based on the real-world performance observed during testnet.

### VDF Requirement

One fast CPU core (ideally with SHA-256 extensions) is required to compute the VDF. It’s possible to subscribe to a remote VDF server if you have trouble keeping up with the network.

### Packing Requirement

Before mining a [partition](/protocol/partitions) it must be packed. [Irys’ 2D packing](/protocol/2d-packing) is time-based and can be parallelized. With a modern gaming GPU, a 16TB partition can be packed in a few hours.

### Storage Requirements

Each [partition](/protocol/partitions) is approximately 16TB in size and is intended to be mined on an HDD. Irys’ VDF limits the amount of data that can be mined per partition to 200MB/s. This is well within the transfer rate of enterprise/data center HDD drives.
