# Use Cases

By providing cost-effective onchain state and enabling flexible execution models, Programmable Data opens up new possibilities for developers, including:

## Onchain Incentive Protocols

Irys allows users to submit proofs of their actions to the storage layer. Smart contracts can read these proofs and automatically distribute rewards, enabling decentralized incentive protocols. For example, social media engagement can be tracked and rewarded based on activity.

## Decentralized Incentives for DePINs

DePIN protocols can use Programmable Data to reward node operators based on their contributions, incentivizing a robust decentralized network without centralized control. Proofs of infrastructure deployment can be recorded to the storage layer and validated by smart contracts.

## Crowdsourced Datasets

Data providers can submit proofs of their contributions to the storage layer. Smart contracts can verify and reward these contributions, creating new models for crowdsourcing high-quality data and ensuring data integrity.

## Data Availability Sampling Rewards

Irys supports a seamless deployment for a Data Availability (DA) layer. Users can encode their data, post it to Irys' storage layer, and receive rewards through a DA contract that processes sampling proofs. This ensures data is retrievable globally and participants are fairly compensated.

## Bridging to Legacy Systems

Irys makes building a decentralized SMTP service straightforward. Tokens can be used to incentivize SMTP servers, with management and rewards distribution handled onchain. This integration supports communication systems compatible with legacy email protocols while operating on a decentralized network.

## Real-Time Multiplayer Gaming

Irysâ€™ Programmable Data enables high-performance game state management off-chain while using smart contracts for conflict resolution and maintaining the authoritative game state. Game clients submit moves to the storage layer, and smart contracts validate and update the game state. This provides a secure platform for real-time multiplayer games, enhancing the gaming experience without sacrificing decentralization.
