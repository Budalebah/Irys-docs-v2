# Programmable data

## Overview

Programmable Data is a simple yet powerful concept: the ability for smart contracts to access any data provably stored on the network. Irys’s advancements give smart contracts access to the entirety of onchain data during execution. With Programmable Data, decentralized applications are free to explore a new frontier, fueled by computation meeting data at scale.
Key Features

## Key Features

### Cheap Cross-Contract Composability

Traditionally, sharing state between contracts is expensive due to stringent security requirements. Programmable Data offers a cheaper method by allowing contracts to record data onchain and store the byte offset in their state. Other contracts can access this data by referencing the offset, eliminating costly cross-contract calls.

### Onchain Discoverability

Previously, developers had to rely on external tools to discover onchain programs. Programmable Data brings discoverability to the execution layer. Smart contracts can now access onchain registries directly, enhancing composability and reducing friction.

### Transaction Information Awareness

Irys's Programmable Data allows smart contracts to access transaction information like headers and interactions. This enables developers to create protocols that observe onchain activity, unlocking new possibilities for automation and interaction.

### Flexible Execution

Programmable Data enables new execution models beyond direct interaction with Irys's VM. This includes lazy evaluation, where state interactions are executed only when read, and secure rollups, where execution environments publish their state to Irys’s data layer.
