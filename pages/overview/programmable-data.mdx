# Programmable data

### Programmable Data

- The merging of data and compute/programmability, where compute is closely coupled to data.
- Allows creation of verifiable data applications built directly onchain at internet scale.
- Enables access to uploaded transaction data within the VM.
- Allows creation of logic aware of individual transactions, such as proving verifiable compute done onchain.

**Two phases**

1. Smart contracts being able to access transaction metadata
2. Start contracts actually getting the data
   - The more data you use, the more gas you spend
   - There will probably be limits as to the amount of data you can bring in
   - Probably can only get data on Publish Ledger (Permanent data)
   - We'll add opcodes like READDATA
     - We'll add some sort of abstraction on top of this

**Use Cases**

- **SMTP Bridge Nodes**

  - Build an onchain message replacement compatible with the legacy SMTP email protocol.
  - Develop inbox experience, account management, message sending, and storing all onchain with Irys.
  - Run a decentralized SMTP mail server to send and receive messages from a Gmail inbox.
  - Token incentivization for SMTP servers using an ERC-20 token secured by the EVM.
  - Manage SMTP servers through indexed data stored onchain, operated by smart contracts.
  - Programmatically distribute rewards based on onchain activity of SMTP servers.

- **DA Sampling Layer**

  - Challenge participating peers with availability proofs and evaluate DA proofs.
  - Slash offending peer/validator when necessary.
  - Manage DA for different client applications through smart contracts.
  - Use smart contract state and onchain data to manage what data is supposed to be onchain and available.
  - Validate erasure coding for DA data with Irys smart contracts.
  - Light clients read data from participants and post fraud or availability proofs as needed.

- **Verifiable Compute on Large Datasets within a Single Chain**
  - Store large datasets onchain and host AI datasets and compute within a single chain.
  - Provide liquidity for the ecosystem through a DeFi endowment.
  - Power AI agent systems with onchain storage and compute.
