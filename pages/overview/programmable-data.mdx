Programmable Data is a powerful concept that allows smart contracts to access any data stored on the network. Irys makes this possible by giving smart contracts access to the entirety of onchain data during execution. With Programmable Data, decentralized applications can explore new possibilities, combining computation and data on a large scale.

## Key Features

### Cheap Cross-Contract Composability

Traditionally, information sharing between contracts is expensive due to stringent security requirements. Programmable Data offers a more cost-effective method by allowing contracts to record data onchain and store the location of that data in the contract. Other contracts can then access this data by referencing the location, eliminating the burden of storing information in costly smart contract state storage.

### Onchain Discoverability

Previously, developers had to rely on external tools to discover onchain programs. Now, Programmable Data brings discoverability to the execution layer and smart contracts can now directly access onchain registries, enhancing composability and reducing friction.

### Transaction Information Awareness

Irys' Programmable Data allows smart contracts to access onchain transaction information like headers and interactions. This enables developers to create protocols that observe onchain activity, unlocking new possibilities for automation and interaction.

### Flexible Execution

Programmable Data enables new execution models beyond direct interaction with Irys's VM, including lazy evaluation (executing actions only when needed) and secure rollups (publishing execution results to the data layer). This flexibility allows for more efficient and secure operations with flexible performance based on developer use cases.

## Use Cases

### Onchain Incentive Protocols

Irys allows users to submit proofs of their actions to the storage layer. Smart contracts can read these proofs and automatically distribute rewards, enabling decentralized incentive protocols. For example, social media engagement can be tracked and rewarded based on activity.

### Decentralized Incentives for Physical Infrastructure (DePINs)

DePIN protocols can use Programmable Data to reward node operators based on their contributions, incentivizing a robust decentralized network without centralized control. Proofs of infrastructure deployment can be recorded to the storage layer and validated by smart contracts.

### Crowdsourced Datasets

Data providers can submit proofs of their contributions to the storage layer. Smart contracts can verify and reward these contributions, creating new models for crowdsourcing high-quality data and ensuring data integrity.

### Growth/Engagement Campaigns

Projects can use Programmable Data to incentivize user engagement by recording proofs of desired activities and distributing rewards automatically. This model supports growth, adoption, and user interaction in a decentralized manner.

### Data Availability Sampling Rewards

Irys supports a seamless deployment for a Data Availability (DA) layer. Users can encode their data, post it to Irys' storage layer, and receive rewards through a DA contract that processes sampling proofs. This ensures data is retrievable globally and participants are fairly compensated.

### Bridging to Legacy Systems

Irys makes building a decentralized SMTP service straightforward. Tokens can be used to incentivize SMTP servers, with management and rewards distribution handled onchain. This integration supports communication systems compatible with legacy email protocols while operating on a decentralized network.

### Real-Time Multiplayer Gaming

Irysâ€™ Programmable Data enables high-performance game state management off-chain while using smart contracts for conflict resolution and maintaining the authoritative game state. Game clients submit moves to the storage layer, and smart contracts validate and update the game state. This provides a secure platform for real-time multiplayer games, enhancing the gaming experience without sacrificing decentralization.
