# Programmable data

## Programmable Data

- The merging of data and compute/programmability, where compute is closely coupled to data.
- Allows creation of verifiable data applications built directly onchain at internet scale.
- Enables access to uploaded transaction data within the VM.
- Allows creation of logic aware of individual transactions, such as proving verifiable compute done onchain.

## Project ideas

With programmable data, builders are able to build a new class of decentralized applications that were previously impossible. Including:
