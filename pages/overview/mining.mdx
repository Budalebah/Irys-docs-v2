# Mining

Irys' mining is a combination of:

- Useful Proof of Work.
- Staking a mining address.
- Pedging individual [partitions](/protocol/partitions).

## System Requirements

The minimum system requirements will be established based on the real-world performance observed during testnet.

### VDF Requirement

One fast CPU core (ideally with SHA-256 extensions) is required to compute the VDF. It’s possible to subscribe to a remote VDF server if you have trouble keeping up with the network.

### Packing Requirement

Before mining a [partition](/protocol/partitions) it must be packed. [Irys’ 2D packing](/protocol/2d-packing) is time-based and can be parallelized. With a modern gaming GPU, a 16TB partition can be packed in a few hours.

### Storage Requirements

Each [partition](/protocol/partitions) is approximately 16TB in size and is intended to be mined on an HDD. Irys’ VDF limits the amount of data that can be mined per partition to 200MB/s. This is well within the transfer rate of enterprise/data center HDD drives.
