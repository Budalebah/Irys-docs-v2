# Mining Guide

Mining Irys is a combination of useful Proof of Work, where every computed hash is actually proving storage of a random part of Irys’ overall storage, and staking a mining address and pledging individual partitions.

## Staking a Mining Address

1. Create a wallet
2. Mint some tokens to it
3. Post a staking transaction to the network
4. Wait for the transaction to be confirmed.

## Pledging a Partition

Once you have a staked mining address you can pledge one or more partitions.

1. Post a pledge transaction, wait until the end of the <a className="underline decoration-dashed" id="epoch">epoch.</a>
2. Your node will tell you if the protocol assigned you a partition ID.
3. If it did, the node will begin packing it.
4. Regardless if you finish packing in time or not, the node will begin mining your partition in the next epoch.

## System Requirements

The minimum system requirements will be established based on the real-world performance observed during testnet.

### VDF Requirement

One fast CPU core to compute the VDF. Ideally with SHA-256 extensions. It’s possible to subscribe to a remote VDF server if you have trouble keeping up with the network.

### Packing Requirement

Before mining a [partition](/protocol/partitions) it must be packed. Irys’ 2D packing is time -based and can be parallelized. With a modern gaming GPU, a 16TB partition can be packed in a few hours.

### Storage Requirements

Each [partition](/protocol/partitions) is approximately 16TB in size and is intended to be mined on an HDD. Irys’ VDF limits the amount of data that can be mined per partition to 200MB/s. This is well within the transfer rate of enterprise/data center HDD drives.
