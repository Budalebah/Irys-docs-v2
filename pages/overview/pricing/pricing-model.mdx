# Pricing Model

Irys has an up-front one-time fee model which simplifies the development and deployment of onchain applications.

The pricing model for the future cost of storage is based on a fixed model, defined by:

- Annualized cost of storing 1GB
- Annualized decay rate
- Safe minimum number of years

Of the three, only the annualized cost of storing 1GB is updated from year to year.

## Annualized Cost of Storing 1GB

The pricing model uses the annualized cost of storing 1GB, as determined by the pricing parameter, as its starting point.

## Annualized Decay Rate

The model assumes a conservative 1% annual decay rate in storage costs, accounting for a wide range potential improvements in technology and market efficiency over time.

## Safe Minimum Number of Years

The pricing model calculates the one-time storage fee based on a safe minimum number of years, initially set to 200 years. This ensures that the fee charged is sufficient to cover storage costs for an extended period, providing peace of mind to users. The safety margins baked into the pricing model mean that in all but the very worst of outcomes the network can afford to pay for storage many multiples of 200 years into the future.
