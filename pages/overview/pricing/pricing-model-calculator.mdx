## Pricing Model Calculator

Given the following pricing parameters:

| Parameter                        | Value     |
| -------------------------------- | --------- |
| Annualized Storage Cost (per GB) | $0.01     |
| Number of Replicas               | 10        |
| Safe Minimum Time                | 200 years |
| Decay Rate                       | 1%        |

This is how to calculate the price of storage in USD:

<StoragePriceFormula />

Therefore, the total cost of storing a single replica of 1GB for 200 years, with a continuous annual decay rate of 1%, is approximately $0.8647.

This results in a storage cost of **$8.65** per GB of permanent data ($0.8647×10≈$8.65).

### Compute User Fee

Let's say a user would like to store 200MB at time t with the following parameters.
