# What is Irys?

Irys is the first datachain that combines [storage](/overview/storage) and execution, enabling [Programmable Data](/overview/execution/programmable-data) and simplifying building fully decentralized applications.

The network is built to be the most useful place for crypto teams to store data, and unlocks are significant. Builders can now seamlessly access, tokenize, and transfer ownership of data onchain, all within a single network.

> As an EVM-compatible network, Irys offers a familiar - yet powerful - environment for building the next generation of decentralized applications.

Irys introduces a new paradigm in decentralized computing by combining adaptive storage with smart contract execution. This enables direct communication between smart contracts and data, significantly reducing costs and complexity.

Irys supports both temporary and permanent storage, catering to a wide range of applications. By unifying storage and execution, Irys provides a versatile foundation for diverse projects across social, DeFi, AI, and DePIN.
