# What is Irys

Irys is the first datachain that combines [storage](/overview/storage) and execution, enabling [programmable data](/overview/execution/programmable-data) and simplifying building fully decentralized applications. Builders can create fully decentralized applications within a single network, eliminating the need for multiple protocols.

> As an EVM-compatible network, Irys offers a familiar - yet powerful - environment for building the next generation of decentralized applications.

Irys introduces a new paradigm in decentralized computing by combining adaptive storage with smart contract execution. This enables direct communication between smart contracts and data, significantly reducing costs and complexity.

The network supports both temporary and permanent storage, catering to a wide range of applications. By unifying storage and execution, Irys provides a versatile foundation for diverse projects across social media, DeFi, AI, and DePIN.

Notably, Irys' architecture allows for scalable, efficient operations without compromising on decentralization.
