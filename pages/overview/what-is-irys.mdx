# What is Irys

Irys is the first datachain that combines [storage](/overview/storage) and execution, enabling [programmable data](/overview/execution/programmable-data) and simplifying the development process. Builders can create comprehensive solutions within a single network, eliminating the need for multiple protocols. As an EVM-compatible network, Irys offers a familiar yet powerful environment for building the next generation of applications.

Irys introduces a new paradigm in decentralized infrastructure by combining adaptive storage with smart contract execution. This enables direct communication between smart contracts and data, significantly reducing costs and complexity.

The networkâ€™s flexibility supports both temporary and permanent storage needs, catering to a wide range of applications. By unifying storage, liquidity, DeFi, and social functionalities, Irys provides a versatile foundation for diverse projects across social media, DeFi, AI, and DePIN.

Notably, Irys's architecture allows for scalable, efficient operations without compromising on decentralization. This approach positions Irys as a key enabler for the next generation of Web3 innovation.
