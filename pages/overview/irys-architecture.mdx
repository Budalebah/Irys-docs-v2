## Overview 
Irys combines high performance with robust verification, providing a secure execution layer for on-chain data. Traditional storage protocols often sacrificed one for the other, hampering secure execution integration. Irys overcomes this tradeoff by uniting Proof of Work (PoW) with staking and slashing mechanisms. This enables efficient data handling alongside robust security for fully on-chain applications. We call this integration of secure storage and execution layers in a single protocol Programmable Data.

**Welcome to Irys** — the chain for programmable data

## Key Features

### Efficient Sampling
- Enables economical storage scaling with a 24-hour sampling window for 16TB HDDs.

### Fast 2D Packing
Combined with staked mining addresses, enables incentive-compatible packing that:
 - Scales horizontally
 - Reduces packing costs
 - Increases the network's ability to ingest data

### Capacity Mining  
- Allows pre-packing of empty capacity partitions for efficient data ingress.

### Verifiability
 - End users can easily verify onchain which mining addresses are storing their data.
 - 2D Unpacking is cross-platform and can be done on consumer hardware, even in a browser.

## Components  

### Proof of Work + Staking
- Combines efficient sampling of PoW with economic deterrents inherent in staking and slashing, to ensure secure and scalable data storage and execution.

### Submit + Publish Ledgers
Allows the protocol to:
 - Make commitments about published data
 - Provide reliable access for the execution layer by managing data upload and storage proofs

### IrysVM
- The virtual machine enabling Programmable Data — the execution of onchain programs with full access to the data layer.

### Protocol Treasury  
More than just an endowment, Irys's treasury:
 - Covers storage liabilities
 - Participates in yield-bearing activities

Irys is designed to resolve the trade-offs between performance and verifiability in storage protocols, unlocking the potential for onchain apps and services that perform computation on the entire data layer, achieving true programmable data.
