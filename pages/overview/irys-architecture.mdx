	The chain for programmable data
</div>

## Architecture

Irys combines high performance with robust verification, providing a native execution layer for onchain data. Traditional storage protocols struggle to balance these two aspects, making it difficult to manage execution and storage in the same chain. Irys overcomes this tradeoff by uniting Proof of Work (PoW) with staking and slashing mechanisms. This enables Irys to efficiently handle data alongside having robust security for fully onchain applications.

We call this integration of secure storage and native execution in a single protocol [Programmable Data](/overview/programmable-data).

## Components

Irys is designed to resolve the trade-offs between performance and verifiability in storage protocols, unlocking the potential for onchain apps and services that perform computation on the entire data layer, achieving true programmable data.
