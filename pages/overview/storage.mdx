# Storage

Irys supports:

- Permanent and temporary onchain data.
- Cryptographic verification to confirm onchain storage.
- A single-payment model for data uploads.
- Fault-tolerant data stored by a geographically diverse group of miners.
- Seamless integration between data and smart contracts, enabling new creative opportunities for builders.

## Ledgers

When you upload data to Irys, the transaction header is immediately included in the next block, and the associated data is uploaded after. This separation accommodates large file uploads that take longer than Irysâ€™ blocktime.

Irys manages data with multiple [ledgers](/protocol/ledgers), each designed to handle different storage terms.

### Permanent Data (Publish Ledger)

The [Publish Ledger](/protocol/ledgers#permanent-data-publish-ledger) contains data provably uploaded to the network, this results in a Publish Ledger without holes.

> Smart contracts can access all data posted to the Publish Ledger.

### Term Data Ledgers

[Term Data ledgers](/protocol/ledgers#term-data-ledgers) store temporary data with defined expiration periods.

At launch, Irys will implement a single term-ledger called the Submit Ledger, with plans to offer more based on community feedback. Transactions are first posted to the Submit Ledger, and once the data has been provably uploaded, it is promoted to the Publish Ledger.
