# Storage

Irys offers a streamlined approach to data storage onchain. With a single upfront fee, users can securely store data for either permanent or temporary periods. The protocol ensures fault-tolerance, high availability and data integrity through a global network of miners and cryptographic verification.

> Notably, Irys allows smart contracts to interact directly with stored data, opening up new possibilities for builders to create innovative applications.

## Fees

Irys offers a flexible and cost-effective data storage solution tailored to users' needs. Our [ledger](/protocol/ledgers) system allows users to choose between different storage terms, paying only for the duration they require. The [Publish Ledger](/protocol/ledgers#permanent-data-publish-ledger) provides permanent storage, ideal for long-term data preservation, while the [Submit Ledger](protocol/ledgers#submit-ledger) offers a more affordable option for shorter-term needs. This dual-ledger approach ensures users can optimize their storage costs based on their specific requirements. As demand grows, Irys plans to introduce additional term options, further enhancing the adaptable storage ecosystem and providing even more choices for users.
