## "Don’t trust, verify."

By overcoming traditional limitations, Irys democratizes verification by making it accessible to all users, regardless of their hardware.

Our data verification is:

- Lightning-fast
- Highly efficient
- Universally accessible

This inclusive approach doesn't just empower users—it unlocks programmable data.

## Programmable Data

For smart contracts to access onchain data during execution, all network participants must agree on the computation outcomes. Rapidly detecting invalid computations by adversarial miners is essential for maintaining network integrity. Fast and efficient data verification ensures that smart contract execution remains swift without compromising security.

## Efficient Data Verification

Irys optimizes data preparation with [2D Packing](/protocol/2d-packing), ensuring consistency and efficiency. Irys incentivizes storage and prevents system abuse while maintaining network integrity by penalizing miners who try to mine unpacked data.
