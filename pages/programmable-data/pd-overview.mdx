# Programmable data

Programmable Data unleashes developer creativity and enables new usecases previously inaccessible due to high state storage costs.

<div className="mt-5">
	<SimpleRiveViewer

		width={850}
		height={300}
		stateMachine="Programmable Data"
	/>
</div>

With Programmable Data, smart contracts can access the entirety of onchain data. This allows developers to break free from the limitations of traditional EVM environments, where state storage is expensive and execution models are rigid.

## Cheap State

In typical EVM environments, storing state within smart contracts is expensive, limiting developers' ability to build complex applications. Programmable Data provides a more cost-effective solution by allowing contracts to use onchain data for verifiable compute. This significantly reduces costs, making it possible to maintain extensive and dynamic datasets.

## Flexible Execution Models

Programmable Data enables new execution models beyond direct interaction with Irys's VM including:

- Lazy evaluation, where actions are executed only when needed.
- Secure rollups, where execution results are published to the data layer.

This flexibility enables developers to optimize performance and security based on each specific [use case](/programmable-data/use-cases).
