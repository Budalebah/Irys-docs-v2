Programmable Data is a powerful concept that allows smart contracts to access any data stored on the network. Irys makes this possible by giving smart contracts access to the entirety of onchain data during execution. With Programmable Data, decentralized applications can explore new possibilities, combining computation and data on a large scale.

## Key Features

### Cheap Cross-Contract Composability

Traditionally, information sharing between contracts is expensive due to stringent security requirements. Programmable Data offers a more cost-effective method by allowing contracts to record data onchain and store the location of that data in the contract. Other contracts can then access this data by referencing the location, eliminating the burden of storing information in costly smart contract state storage.

### Onchain Discoverability

Previously, developers had to rely on external tools to discover onchain programs. Now, Programmable Data brings discoverability to the execution layer and smart contracts can now directly access onchain registries, enhancing composability and reducing friction.

### Transaction Information Awareness

Irys' Programmable Data allows smart contracts to access onchain transaction information like headers and interactions. This enables developers to create protocols that observe onchain activity, unlocking new possibilities for automation and interaction.

### Flexible Execution

Programmable Data enables new execution models beyond direct interaction with Irys's VM, including lazy evaluation (executing actions only when needed) and secure rollups (publishing execution results to the data layer). This flexibility allows for more efficient and secure operations with flexible performance based on developer use cases.
