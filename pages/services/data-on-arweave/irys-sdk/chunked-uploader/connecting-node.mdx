# Connecting to a node

When using the chunking uploader, first connect to a node using the same flow as with our default uploader and then follow that by requesting the chunked uploader using `irys.uploader.chunkedUploader`.

You can use any of our [public and Devnet node addresses.](/overview/nodes)

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
	The chunkedUploader object reference must be updated before each subsequent upload, it can not be reused.
</Callout>

```js
let irys = await getIrys();

let uploader = irys.uploader.chunkedUploader;
```
