# Migration guide

Migrating your application from the Bundlr SDK to the Irys SDK is a simple process.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
	All existing legacy packages will be maintained until October 2024 and will continue to work until at least October
	2025. All domains will be supported in perpetuity (e.g., https://node1.bundlr.network)
</Callout>

## Installation

Install the Irys SDK using npm:

```console
npm install @irys/sdk
```

or yarn:

```console
yarn add @irys/sdk
```

## Imports

Change your import statements from:

```js
import Bundlr from "@bundlr-network/client";
```

to:

```js
import Irys from "@irys/sdk";
```

## Name Changes

Apart from rebrand to Irys, certain elements within the SDK have undergone a name change.

WebBundlr and (Node)Bundlr have been changed to WebIrys and (Node)Irys respectively. \
_All_ usage of `currency` in the SDK has been replaced with `token`, notably the argument as part of client instantiation (see [Constructor](migration-guide#constructor))
as well as internal APIs (such as currencyConfig -> tokenConfig)

## Constructor

In the Bundlr SDK, parameters are passed directly. In the Irys SDK, parameters are passed inside an options object.

Update `new Bundlr` to `new Irys` and then wrap your constructor arguments in `{}`.

```js
const url = "https://devnet.irys.xyz";
// Devnet RPC URLs change often, use a recent one from https://chainlist.org/
const providerUrl = "";
const token = "ethereum";

const bundlr = new Bundlr(url, token, process.env.PRIVATE_KEY);

const irys = new Irys({
	url, // URL of the node you want to connect to
	token, // Token used to pay for uploads
	key: process.env.PRIVATE_KEY, // ETH or SOL private key
	config: { providerUrl }, // Optional provider URL, only required when using Devnet
});
```

## Domain Changes

With the release of the Irys SDK our domain has changed from `https://bundlr.network` to `https://irys.xyz`. When upgrading your code, you shouldsla change your Node URLs:

| Bundlr Node Address             | Irys Node Address         |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `https://node1.bundlr.network`  | `https://node1.irys.xyz`  |
| `https://node2.bundlr.network`  | `https://node2.irys.xyz`  |
| `https://devnet.bundlr.network` | `https://devnet.irys.xyz` |

And your GraphQL endpoints

| Bundlr GraphQL Endpoint                 | Irys GraphQL Endpoint             |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `https://node1.bundlr.network/graphql`  | `https://node1.irys.xyz/graphql`  |
| `https://node2.bundlr.network/graphql`  | `https://node2.irys.xyz/graphql`  |
| `https://devnet.bundlr.network/graphql` | `https://devnet.irys.xyz/graphql` |

## Changes to upload functions

In the Bundlr SDK there were separate upload functions depending on whether you wanted a receipt or not. With the Irys SDK, all upload functions return a [receipt](/learn/receipts).

The following function is deprecated:

- `bundlr.uploadWithReceipt()`

The following functions upload data as before however, the return type has changed to be a receipt.

- [`irys.upload()`](./api/upload) To upload any data
- [`irys.uploadFile()`](./api/uploadFile) To upload a file
- [`irys.uploadFolder()`](./api/uploadFolder) To upload a folder

## Change to WebBundlr / WebIrys

With the Bundlr SDK, using providers other than Ethers 5 required extra setup code unique to each provider. Now, we natively support multiple different provider types.

When connecting to a `WebIrys` class, you pass both a reference to a provider and the provider type. The following example is for Ethers 5, we also have a full list of supported provider types see [Irys in the browser](/developer-docs/irys-sdk/irys-in-the-browser).

```js
const getWebIrys = async () => {
	// Ethers5 provider
	await window.ethereum.enable();
	const provider = new providers.Web3Provider(window.ethereum);

	const url = "https://node1.irys.xyz";
	const token = "ethereum";
	// Devnet RPC URLs change often, use a recent one from https://chainlist.org/
	const rpcUrl = "";

	// Create a wallet object
	const wallet = { rpcUrl: rpcUrl, name: "ethersv5", provider: provider };
	// Use the wallet object
	const webIrys = new WebIrys({ url, token, wallet });
	await webIrys.ready();

	return webIrys;
};
```
