## Prerequisites

To install our CLI, you will need to install a [current version of node](https://nodejs.org/en) first.

## Installing the CLI

Install our CLI globally using the `-g` flag. Depending on your setup, you may or may not need to use `sudo`.

```console
npm i -g @irys/sdk
sudo npm i -g @irys/sdk
```

## Using private keys

When executing CLI commands involving funding nodes or signing transactions, you must provide a private key.

Use the `-w` flag to specify a private key along with the `-t` flag to indicate the token you'll use.

```console
irys -w <wallet-file-name> -t <token>
```

The methods for supplying private keys differ for Ethereum and Solana compared to Arweave.

### Ethereum / Solana

For Ethereum and Solana, specify the private key directly in the command line every time you execute a CLI command. Note that the CLI does not store the private key, it needs to be included with each command.

```console
irys fund 1000000000000000 -t ethereum -w bf20......c9885307 -n mainnet
```

### Arweave

When using Arweave, the private key is typically stored in a file (commonly named `wallet.json`). This file is then referenced in the CLI command, instead of specifying the private key directly.

```console
irys fund 1000000000000000 -t arweave -w wallet.json -n mainnet
```

## Networks

Fund the network you plan to upload to.

```console
# Mainnet
irys -n mainnet

# Devnet
irys -n devnet
```

When connecting to Devnet, you must supply the additional `--provider-url` parameter.

```console
irys -n devnet --provider-url https://rpc.sepolia.dev
```

</Callout>

## Funding

Use the `fund` command to fund a node.

```console
irys fund 1000000000000000 -n mainnet -t ethereum -w bf20......c9885307
```

## Withdrawing funds

Use the `withdraw` command to withdraw funds from a node.

```console
irys withdraw 1000000000000000 -n mainnet -t ethereum -w bf20......c9885307
```

## Uploading a file

Use the `upload` command to upload a file.

```console
irys upload myImage.png -n mainnet -t ethereum -w bf20......c9885307
```

## Uploading a folder

Use the `upload-dir` command to upload a folder.

```console
irys upload-dir ./myImages -n mainnet -t ethereum -w bf20......c9885307
```

## Using tags

Use the `-t` option, followed by a series of name / value pairs to append metadata tags to your upload.

Irys supports adding any optional [metadata tags](/developer-docs/tags) to each upload. When uploading files with a filename extension, the related [`Content-Type`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Type) (MIME type) tag is automatically added.

```console
irys upload myImage.png -t tagName1 tagValue1 tagName2 tagValue2 -n mainnet -t ethereum -w bf20......c9885307
```

## Pricing

Use the `price` command, followed by a number of bytes to get the cost to upload that number of bytes. You must also provide a token (`-t`) and a node URL (`-h`)

```console
irys price 1000000 -t ethereum -n mainnet
```
