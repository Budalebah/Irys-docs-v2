# Fund / withdraw

The [Fund Withdraw component](https://provenance-toolkit.irys.xyz/fund-withdraw) is used to manage node balances.

## Funding and withdrawing

When uploading data to Irys, first fund a balance [on our mainnet or devnet](/overview/networks).

## Customizing the UI

The FundWithdraw component provides a default UI that includes options for the end user to select a node, choose a token, and decide between funding or withdrawing.

You can also modify the UI to hardwire the node address, token, or fix the mode (either to "fund-only" or "withdraw-only") using configuration parameters.

| Description               | Code                                    |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Default Behavior          | `<FundWithdraw />`                      |
| Fix the network           | `<FundWithdraw network="mainnet" />`    |
| Fix the token             | `<FundWithdraw token="ethereum" />`     |
| Set to fund-only mode     | `<FundWithdraw fundOnly={ true } />`    |
| Set to withdraw-only mode | `<FundWithdraw withdrawOnly={ true }/>` |

If both fundOnly and withdrawOnly are set to false, the component defaults to fund-only mode.

## Code

The component is designed to be used as-is. Users making significant changes to the UI will need to understand the following.

### Getting funded balance

When the component is set to "withdraw" mode, the UI will automatically check and display the user's currently funded balance. As balances are both node and token-specific, this balance check is encapsulated within a `useEffect()` hook that gets triggered when the component mounts and also whenever the user changes either the selected node or token.

To get the currently funded balance, first connect to a Irys node using the node and token selected by the user:

```ts filename="components/FundWithdraw.tsx"
const irys = await getIrys(selectedNode?.value, selectedToken?.value);
```

Then retrieve the loaded balance in atomic units:

```ts filename="components/FundWithdraw.tsx"
await irys.getLoadedBalance();
```

And convert to standard units before setting to a React state variable:

```ts filename="components/FundWithdraw.tsx"
setAmount(irys.utils.fromAtomic(loadedBalance));
```

Here’s the full code:

```ts filename="components/FundWithdraw.tsx"
useEffect(() => {
	setAmount(0);
	const getCurBalance = async () => {
		try {
			const irys = await getIrys(selectedNode?.value, selectedToken?.value);
			const loadedBalance = await irys.getLoadedBalance();

			// Show currently funded balance iff we're in withdraw mode
			if (!isFunding) setAmount(irys.utils.fromAtomic(loadedBalance));
		} catch (error) {
			console.log("Error connecting to Irys:", error);
		}
	};
	if (selectedNode && selectedToken) getCurBalance();
}, [selectedNode, selectedToken, isFunding]);
```

### Funding & withdrawing

Funding and withdrawing happen in the function `handleFundWithdraw()`. This function first validates input, then connects to a Irys node:

```ts filename="components/FundWithdraw.tsx"
const irys = await getIrys(selectedNode?.value, selectedToken?.value);
```

When funding, it converts the value entered by the user to atomic units and then uses that value to fund:

```ts filename="components/FundWithdraw.tsx"
const fundTx = await irys.fund(irys.utils.toAtomic(amount));
```

When withdrawing, it converts the value entered by the user to atomic units and then uses that value to withdraw:

```ts filename="components/FundWithdraw.tsx"
const fundTx = await irys.withdrawBalance(irys.utils.toAtomic(amount));
```

### Atomic units

When funding and withdrawing using the functions [`irys.fund()`](/developer-docs/irys-sdk/api/fund) or [`irys.withdrawBalance()`](/developer-docs/irys-sdk/api/withdrawBalance), pass a value in atomic units.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
	Atomic units refer to the smallest possible unit of a given cryptocurrency. In Ethereum, atomic units are called Wei,
	and they represent the smallest unit of Ether. Similar to how 1 dollar can be broken down into 100 cents, 1 Ether can
	be broken down into 10^18 Wei. In Solana, atomic units are called Lamports, 1 SOL can be broken down into 10^9
	Lamports.
