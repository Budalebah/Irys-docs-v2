# Downloading data

Once data is uploaded to Irys, it becomes instantly accessible through [gateways](/overview/gateways), which work hand in hand with our [optimistic cache](/learn/optimistic-cache). To download data, use the transaction id to query the relevant gateway.

There are multiple gateways, including those running open source software that can be spun up by anyone. Here are examples of how to use the two most common ones.

## Irys gateway

### URL format

`https://gateway.irys.xyz/[transaction-id]`

### Example

`https://gateway.irys.xyz/CO9EpX0lekJEfXUOeXncUmMuG8eEp5WJHXl9U9yZUYA`

## Arweave gateway

### URL format

`https://arweave.net/[transaction-id]`

### Example

`https://arweave.net/CO9EpX0lekJEfXUOeXncUmMuG8eEp5WJHXl9U9yZUYA`
