# Ledgers

Irys tracks uploaded transacting using multiple <a className="underline decoration-dashed" id="ledger">ledgers</a> on a single blockchain, departing from the traditional single-ledger model.

Alongside these ledgers, Irys‚Äô blocks maintain two <a className="underline decoration-dashed" id="blocklane">blocklanes</a>:

- An execution blocklane for [value transfers](/protocol/transactions#value-transfers) and [smart contract interactions](/protocol/transactions#execution-transactions).
- A storage blocklane for data storage transactions.

## Transaction History

While Irys maintains a transaction history in its blocks, the associated data is recorded in different ledgers.

<Callout type="info" emoji="üí°">
	The separation of transactions from their data enables Irys to scale and store large amounts of data. The
	network produces blocks at a regular cadence, containing storage transactions that include digital
	fingerprints of their data and reserve space for it. The data itself can be uploaded over the course of
	the next few blocks, using the fingerprint in the transaction to validate the upload.
</Callout>

These ledgers have different storage terms, and users specify their intended ledger when posting a data transaction.

## Permanent Data (Publish Ledger)

This flagship ledger maintains 10 replicas across geographically distributed miners who have made economic commitments through staking and pledging.

The Publish Ledger contains only data provably uploaded to the network, backed through the Submit Ledger system. **This results in a Publish Ledger without holes, enabling reliable data retrieval for use within Irys‚Äôs programmable data smart contract computations.**

## Term Data Ledgers

Term Data ledgers store "temporary" data with defined expiration periods. Irys uses the word ‚Äúterm‚Äù to describe these ledgers as it makes a commitment to store the data for a specific storage term. At launch, Irys will implement a single term-ledger called the Submit Ledger, with plans to offer more term options based on community feedback.

### Submit Ledger

The Submit Ledger:

- Addresses the challenge of verifying data publishing for smart contract execution.
- Is used to provide temporary onchain data.

Transactions are first posted to the Submit Ledger, giving users a 5 <a className="underline decoration-dashed" id="epoch">epoch</a> window to upload associated data. If the data isn‚Äôt posted during that time, the space reserved for it expires.

<Callout type="info" emoji="üí°">
	Data expires after 5 epochs if not uploaded, however the associated transaction header is part of the
	blockchain's immutable ledger.
</Callout>

If the data is posted, miners provide receipt proofs, and once enough are collected, the data is promoted to the Publish Ledger. Once data has been promoted to the Publish Ledger, smart contracts can access it.

The combination of Submit and Publish ledgers enables Irys to make commitments about uploaded data and fairly apply slashing penalties to miners who fail to store assigned data. This leads to high-quality, verifiable onchain data suitable for smart contract operations.
