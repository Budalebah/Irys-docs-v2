# Ledgers

While Irys maintains a transaction history in its blocks, the associated data is recorded in different ledgers. Irys uses multiple <a className="underline decoration-dashed" id="ledger">ledgers</a> on a single blockchain, departing from the traditional single-ledger model.

<Callout type="info" emoji="üí°">
	The separation of transactions from their data enables Irys to scale and store large amounts of data. The
	network produces blocks at a regular cadence, containing storage transactions that include digital
	fingerprints of their data and reserve space for it. The data itself can be uploaded over the course of
	the next few blocks, using the fingerprint in the transaction to validate the upload.
</Callout>

Alongside these ledgers, Irys‚Äô maintains two <a className="underline decoration-dashed" id="blocklane">blocklanes</a>:

- An execution blocklane for [value transfers](/protocol/transactions#value-transfers) and [smart contract interactions](/protocol/transactions#execution-transactions).
- A storage blocklane for data storage transactions.

These ledgers have different storage terms, and users specify their intended ledger when posting a data transaction.

## Permanent Data (Publish Ledger)

The Publish Ledger contains only data provably uploaded to the network. **This results in a Publish Ledger without holes, enabling reliable data retrieval for use within Irys‚Äô programmable data smart contract computations.**

This flagship ledger is replicated across 10 geographically distributed miners who have made economic commitments through staking and pledging.

## Term Data Ledgers

Term Data ledgers store "temporary" data with defined expiration periods. Irys uses the word ‚Äúterm‚Äù to describe these ledgers as it makes a commitment to store the data for a specific storage term.

At launch, Irys will implement a single term ledger called the Submit Ledger, with plans to offer more term options based on community feedback.

### Submit Ledger

Transactions are first posted to the Submit Ledger, giving users a 5 <a className="underline decoration-dashed" id="epoch">epoch</a> window to upload associated data. If the data isn‚Äôt posted during that time, the space reserved for it expires.

<Callout type="info" emoji="üí°">
	Data expires after 5 epochs if not uploaded, however the associated transaction header is part of the
	blockchain's immutable ledger.
</Callout>

This serves two purposes:

- It is used to provide temporary onchain data.
- It addresses the challenge of verifying data publication for smart contract execution.

Users needing temporary onchain data can post their transactions to the Submit Ledger and let them expire at the end of the term. As upload fees are based on the length of the storage term, this offers significant financial advantages to users who don't require permanent storage.

If the data is posted, miners provide receipt proofs. Once enough proofs are collected, the data is promoted to the Publish Ledger, where smart contracts can access it.

The combination of Submit and Publish ledgers enables Irys to make commitments about uploaded data and fairly apply slashing penalties to miners who fail to store assigned data. This leads to high-quality, verifiable onchain data suitable for smart contract operations.
