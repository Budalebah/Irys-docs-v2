# Partitions

Onchain data is split up into a sequence of slots, each one 16 TIB. Partitions come in two varieties, **data partitions** and **capacity partitions**.

1. **Data partitions** store the data posted to the network.
1. **Capacity partitions** reserve empty drive space to be converted to **data partitions** as data is added to the network.. 

## Storage partitions

- Miners provide storage partitions. Data posted to the network is written to these partitions.
- Before data can be written to a partition, it must be [packed](./packing) with entropy chunks.
- When data is posted to the chain it is XOR'd into the entropy chunks.
- This makes each miners copy of the data (stored in packed entropy chunks) unique and cryptographically verifiable.

### Fault tolerance

- Each slot is assigned multiple partitions serving as backups of its data.
- By having these backup partitions stored by a geographically diverse set of miners, the protocol minimizes the chances of data loss.

## Capacity partitions

- The protocol allocates a second type of partition called "capacity partitions". These are empty partitions that can be mined to earn rewards.
- The protocol manages supply and demand by allocating a number of capacity partitions based on anticipated demand.
- To prove that they are providing a full 16 TiB of storage the protocol requires miners pack these partitions with entropy chunks using their mining address as a digital fingerprint.
- To mine partitions, miners must first stake their mining address. Once staked they can pledge to mine specific partitions allocated by the protocol.
- The protocol allocates new capacity partitions to miners based on their number of staked tokens.
