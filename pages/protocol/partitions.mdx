# Partitions

Onchain data is split up into a sequence of slots, each one 16 TIB.

1. Data is stored in **storage partitions**.
2. Additional **capacity partitions** are online and available to be converted into storage partitions as needed.

## Storage partitions

- Miners provide storage partitions. Data posted to the network is written to these partitions.
- Before data can be written to a partition, it must be [packed](./packing).
- When data is saved, it is XOR'd into the chunks of the capacity partition. This is a computationally simple operation.

### Fault tolerance

- Each slot is assigned multiple partitions serving as backups of its data.
- By having these backup partitions stored by a geographically diverse set of miners, the protocol minimizes the chances of data loss.

## Capacity partitions

- The protocol allocates a second type of partition called "capacity partitions". These are empty partitions that can be mined to earn rewards.
- The protocol manages supply and demand by allocating a number of capacity partitions based on anticipated demand.
- To prove that they are providing a full 16 TiB of storage the protocol requires miners pack these partitions using their mining address as a digital fingerprint.
- To mine partitions, miners must first stake \_\_\_ tokens.
- The protocol allocates new capacity partitions to miners based on their number of staked tokens.
