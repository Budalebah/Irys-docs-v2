# Irys Protocol

Irys enables smart contracts to reliably access and verify large amounts of onchain data. This capability is crucial for network consensus and unlocks new possibilities in decentralized applications.

> Irys takes the stance that a storage protocol that can make commitments about the data uploaded to it is more useful than one that canâ€™t.

When uploading data to Irys, the headers are included in the next block, and the actual data is uploaded to miners afterward. This approach maintains network efficiency while accommodating large data uploads.

To address potential issues from incomplete uploads, smart contracts consistently verify data maintaining integrity and enabling reliable network consensus.

By addressing these core challenges, Irys establishes a new standard for datachains, enabling more powerful and reliable decentralized applications.

## Architecture

Irys seamlessly integrates high-performance storage and verifiable onchain execution in a single protocol.
