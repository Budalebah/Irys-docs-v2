# Irys Protocol

Irys enables smart contracts to reliably access the entirety of onchain data. One of the key challenges with this is ensuring that all network participants have access to the data needed to reliably reach consensus.

> Irys takes the stance that a storage protocol that can make commitments about the data uploaded to it is more useful than one that canâ€™t.

When uploading data to Irys, the headers are included in the next block, and the actual data is uploaded to miners afterward. This approach maintains network efficiency while accommodating large data uploads.

While separating headers from data unlocks large-scale onchain data, it can lead to permanent gaps in the ledger if the promised data is never uploaded. These gaps would then create cascading issues throughout the system.

Irys' design addresses these challenges through a combination of innovations:
