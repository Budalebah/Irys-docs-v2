## Irys' 2D Packing

Packing is the process of adding a unique cryptographic fingerprint to stored data. Miners use packing to prove to the network they're providing unique resources, this prevents adversarial claims of false storage capacity.

Irys' 2D Packing ensures minimum packing time while allowing horizontal scaling across GPUs and ASICs. It enables unpacking on any device, from desktops to mobile browsers, while reducing miner onboarding and data posting costs. The result is lower storage fees for users.

Hereâ€™s how it works:

| Step | Name               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ---- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Data Partitioning  | Data is logically partitioned into 16TB partitions, suitable for individual 16TB HDDs.                                                                                                        |
| 2    | Chunk Division     | Each partition is divided into 256KiB chunks, which are used during mining to produce hashes.                                                                                                 |
| 3    | Segment Creation   | Each 256KiB chunk is further divided into 32-byte segments containing packing entropy from a SHA-256 hash.                                                                                    |
| 4    | Sequential Hashing | Segments are hashed sequentially; each segment's hash input is the output of the previous segment. Sequential hashing establishes a minimum packing time by requiring 8,192 hashes per chunk. |
| 5    | Layered Hashing    | Repeated sequential hashing creates multiple layers of segments, storing the final layer in the chunk.                                                                                        |

## Advantages

Irys' 2D packing operates in parallel, enabling simultaneous chunk processing while maintaining safe individual packing times. This ensures reading packed data is always more economical than packing. Uniquely, 2D Packing allows fingerprinting of empty capacity, rewarding miners for preparedness. When needed, data is swiftly XOR'd into existing packing, eliminating repacking and ensuring rapid, cost-effective data ingress.

This innovative approach optimizes network efficiency and resource utilization

## Blocktimes

The safe minimum time for 2D Packing and unpacking sets a lower limit on block validation time for miners. This establishes a minimum block time for the network, approximately 3 seconds. However, as Proof of Work block times typically range from 9-12 seconds, this constraint doesn't negatively impact network performance.
