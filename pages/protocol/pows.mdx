# Proof of Work + Staking

Irys introduces a hybrid consensus mechanism combining Proof of Work and Staking (PoW+S). Unlike classic PoW, miners on Irys also make economic commitments to specific mining addresses and make pledges to the portions of the [ledger](/protocol/ledgers) they store.

Miners face slashing penalties for inappropriate behavior, creating strong disincentives for adversarial actions compared to pure PoW networks.

Benefits of the hybrid model:

- Higher Commitments: Staked participants ensure greater reliability.
- Known Participants: Efficient communication between known, staked addresses.
- Secure: Staking deters adversarial behavior.
