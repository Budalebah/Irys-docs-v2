# Provable Storage

Irys uses the Proof of Unique Storage (PoUS) to ensures the integrity and possession of data and capacity on the network.

- Storage (both empty capacity and stored data) on Irys is split into 16TiB partitions.
- These partitions are packed with a miners unique address and cryptographic entropy.
- This uniquely identifies the partition as belonging to a specific miner.
- Every second the protocol selects a random 200MB recall range from each partition.
- These recall ranges are split up into 256KiB chunks that can be read and mined.
- Miners read the chunks and compute a solution from each one.
- If the solution exceeds the difficulty setting of the network they win the right to produce a block and earn rewards.
- Any transactions they include in the block will reward the miner with a small fee.
- If the rest of the network accepts the block, it will be added to the head of the chain and miners will build on top of it.
