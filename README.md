# Irys Documentation

Welcome to the Irys documentation repository. These docs are built using [Nextra](https://nextra.site/).

## What is Irys?

Irys is the first datachain that combines storage and execution, enabling Programmable Data and simplifying the building of fully decentralized applications.

### Storage

Irys offers a streamlined approach to onchain data storage. With a single upfront fee, users can securely store data for either permanent or temporary periods. The protocol ensures fault-tolerance, high availability and data integrity through a global network of miners and cryptographic verification.

Notably, Irys allows smart contracts to interact directly with stored data, opening up new possibilities for builders to create innovative applications.

### Execution

With Programmable Data, smart contracts can access the entirety of onchain data. This allows developers to break free from the limitations of traditional EVM environments, where state storage is expensive and execution models are rigid.

Programmable Data unleashes developer creativity and enables new use cases previously inaccessible due to high state storage costs. Developers can now build fully onchain applications, where the UI, state, and all data are stored onchain.
